     * An undirected graph is Eulerian if all nodes have even degree and is semi-eulerian if all nodes have even degree
     * and exactly two nodes have odd degree.
     *
     * For directed graph the fanIn should follow above rule (all node must have even degree) and fanIn should be equals
     * to fanOut for each node. For semi-eulerian one node can have one extra in edge and one node can an extra out
     * edge.
