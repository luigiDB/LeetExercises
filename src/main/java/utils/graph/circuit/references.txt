EULER CIRCUITS AND PATHS
==========================

Euler Paths
An Euler path is a path that uses every edge in a graph with no repeats. Being a path, it does not have to return to
the starting vertex.

Euler Circuits
An Euler circuit is a circuit that uses every edge in a graph with no repeats. Being a circuit, it must start and end
at the same vertex.

EULER’S PATH AND CIRCUIT THEOREMS
A graph will contain an Euler path if it contains at most two vertices of odd degree.
A graph will contain an Euler circuit if all vertices have even degree

FLEURY’S ALGORITHM
1. Start at any vertex if finding an Euler circuit. If finding an Euler path, start at one of the two vertices with
    odd degree.
2. Choose any edge leaving your current vertex, provided deleting that edge will not separate the graph into two
    disconnected sets of edges. (in a real scenario the algorithm can make any choice since with backtracking we can
    cover other paths).
3. Add that edge to your circuit, and delete it from the graph.
4. Continue until you’re done.



HAMILTONIAN CIRCUITS AND PATHS
==========================
A Hamiltonian circuit is a circuit that visits every vertex once with no repeats. Being a circuit, it must start and end
at the same vertex. A Hamiltonian path also visits every vertex once with no repeats, but does not have to start and
end at the same vertex.


BRUTE FORCE ALGORITHM (A.K.A. EXHAUSTIVE SEARCH)
1.     List all possible Hamiltonian circuits
2.     Find the length of each circuit by adding the edge weights
3.     Select the circuit with minimal total weight.

NEAREST NEIGHBOR ALGORITHM (NNA)
1.     Select a starting point.
2.     Move to the nearest unvisited vertex (the edge with smallest weight).
3.     Repeat until the circuit is complete.
