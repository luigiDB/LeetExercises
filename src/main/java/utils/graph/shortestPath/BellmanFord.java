     * Given a graph and a source vertex src in graph, find shortest paths from src to all vertices in the given graph.
     * Bellman-Ford works on Graphs with negative weight edges. Bellman-Ford is also simpler than Dijkstra and suites
     * well for distributed systems. But time complexity of Bellman-Ford is O(VE), which is more than Dijkstra.
