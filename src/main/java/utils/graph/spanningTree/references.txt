MINIMUM COST SPANNING TREE (MCST)
The minimum cost spanning tree is the spanning tree with the smallest total edge weight.

Difference between Kruskal and Prim algorithms
In Prim's, you always keep a connected component, starting with a single vertex. You look at all edges from the current
component to other vertices and find the smallest among them. You then add the neighbouring vertex to the component,
increasing its size by 1. In N-1 steps, every vertex would be merged to the current one if we have a connected graph.
In Kruskal's, you do not keep one connected component but a forest. At each stage, you look at the globally smallest
edge that does not create a cycle in the current forest. Such an edge has to necessarily merge two trees in the current
forest into one. Since you start with N single-vertex trees, in N-1 steps, they would all have merged into one if the
graph was connected.
