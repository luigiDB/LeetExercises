 * Anagram Substring Search (Or Search for all permutations)
 * Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1], write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all
 * occurrences of pat[] and its permutations (or anagrams) in txt[]. You may assume that n > m.
 * Expected time complexity is O(n)
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * 1) Input:  txt[] = "BACDGABCDA"  pat[] = "ABCD"
 *    Output:   Found at Index 0
 *              Found at Index 5
 *              Found at Index 6
 * 2) Input: txt[] =  "AAABABAA" pat[] = "AABA"
 *    Output:   Found at Index 0
 *              Found at Index 1
 *              Found at Index 4
